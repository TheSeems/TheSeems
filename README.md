## Hi there 👋
My name is Alexey Akhundov. I am a student at HSE, Faculty of Computer Science, Software Engineering.

As a software engineer, I specialize in backend technologies.

I like coding, learning and using algorithms, data structures, designing architecture, in general, almost everything related to CS. They change not only mine but all people's lives!
