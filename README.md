## Hi there 👋
My name is Alexey Akhundov. I am an HSE Software Engineering graduate, and I’m currently pursuing my master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence at the HSE Faculty of Computer Science.

As a software engineer, I specialize in backend development and big data tools.

I enjoy coding, studying and applying algorithms, data structures, designing software architecture — in short, almost everything related to computer science.
